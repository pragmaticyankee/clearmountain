<p class="SubStyle">Poetry Circle at Clear Mountain</p>



<p class="ptxt">Clear Mountain Zendo occasionally holds poetry sessions at our zendo at 7 Oak Place, Montclair NJ.  These sessions are a time for poetry lovers involved with Zen (or just involved with life), to gather, share favorite poems or other bits of wisdom, and just ponder our being, within the congenial space where the Clear Mountain sangha sits each week. We recently held two Poetry Circle gatherings, on Sunday March 8th and February 9th, from 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM.



A friend of our sangha has gathered a group of poems that were shared during a 2019 Poetry Circle, and printed them into an attractive booklet, which he made available at the most recent Circle. You can view and download the digital version of this booklet <a href="./pix/PoetryCircle.pdf">HERE</a>. <br><br></p>

The Rohatsu Sesshin is the traditional winter retreat which is held in December in celebrating Buddha's enlightenment. It is one of the year's most important events and takes place at Zen monasteries around the world. It is marked by silence, the practice of zazen, and our mutual support of each other during this time. The only speaking that takes place is during the Dharma talks and Daisan. There are no practice circles. Participates should refrain from social conversation after entering the building. This is a wonderful opportunity to deepen your practice. 
<br><br>

<p class="SubStyle">Sensei Carl Genjo Bachmann's New Book</p>



<p class="ptxt">



Sensei Carl Genjo Bachmann of Clear Mountain Zendo, together with long-term friend and associate Alan Gettis, PhD, are about to publish their first co-authored book entitled "Embracing Life as It Is: Lessons From Wabi-Sabi, Haiku, and Zen". This book combines haiku poetry, striking imagery of otherwise ordinary subjects, and Zen wisdom, so as to convey important lessons regarding selflessness, acceptance, non-discrimination, compassion, and self-compassion. The book was released on Thursday November 15, and is available on Amazon. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Embracing-Life-Lessons-Wabi-Sabi-Haiku/dp/1936636018" target="_blank">CLICK HERE FOR LINK</a><br><br>



The authors are donating all of their proceeds from book sales to the Saint Judes Childrens Research Hospital. Sensei Carl and Dr. Gettis thank everyone for their interest, and hope that this book will provide a positive and supportive experience to all interested in Zen, and to all who hope to "embrace life as it is".

<p class="SubStyle">Clear Mountain / NCJW Food Drive, Period Project</p>



<p class="ptxt">

Clear Mountain Zendo partnered with the National Council of Jewish Women of Essex (NCJW/Essex) in holding a November food drive to support the "Empty Bowls No More" anti-hunger initiative. Gail Sample of NCJW/Essex thanks everyone from Clear Mountain who donated food items for the Thanksgiving food drive or feminine hygiene products for their Period Project. <br><br>





Gail recently told the sangha that the collection will continue year-round; anyone can donate food or hygiene products at any time during the upcoming Sunday zazen sittings. The need amidst the Essex County community for food and hygiene support does not diminish after Thanksgiving, of course. In keeping with Buddha's teachings on compassion, we encourage our sangha to keep in mind this opportunity to help the less fortunate during the upcoming year-end holiday celebration, and on into the new year.<br><br>





Take-home food items are distributed to needy families and individuals through the NCJW Center for Women in Livingston, and through the West Orange Food Pantry, which is located at the Holy Trinity Church, 315 Main Street, West Orange.  This Pantry helps to feed between 300 and 500 people per month, and operates in conjunction with Christine's Kitchen, a hot meal program.<br><br>



Sangha members wishing to support this initiative can bring food items to be collected at our zendo.  We welcome dry packaged or canned food items that are non-perishable, unopened and unexpired.  Supermarket gift cards are also welcomed.  Some examples of appropriate food items include: canned soups, pasta, meat, fruit and vegetables; coffee and tea; peanut butter and jelly; catsup and mayonnaise; canned pork and beans; pasta; bagged rice; canned tuna; bottled juice or juice boxes; cereal; napkins, tissue and toilet paper; baby food; diapers size 3, 4 or 5; toothpaste; and shampoo. we are only allowed to accept unopened, unexpired food items, for health reasons.  In addition, the West Orange Food Pantry has  requested holiday foods including canned yams, cranberry sauce, canned turkey gravy, and stuffing mix.<br><br> 



Clear Mountain is also supporting the NCJW/Essex Period.Project, which provides advocacy and awareness regarding the barriers that many women face in obtaining feminine hygiene products.  Women can spend $75-$125 each year on feminine hygiene products, but lower-income women often have trouble given that neither food stamps nor health insurance can be used to help pay for these items.   Therefore, women report missing work and school due to their lack of access to them. <br><br>  



In order to support NCJW/Essex's Period.Project, Clear Mountain Zendo is also be accepting donations of packaged feminine pads and tampons.   You can usually purchase these at the same supermarket where you would pick up food items for our food drive.  These will be distributed by NCJW in partnership with local community service agencies and through its Center for Women at 70 South Orange Avenue, Livingston, NJ.  <br><br>



WE WILL ACCEPT DONATIONS ON ANY SUNDAY, BUT WE ESPECIALLY ENCOURAGE DONATIONS ON THE THIRD SUNDAY OF EACH MONTH.  WE ARE DESIGNATING THE THIRD SUNDAY AS "THREE JEWELS SUNDAY" TO CELEBRATE OUR CONNECTION, CARING AND OUTREACH TO THE COMMUNITY<br><br>



The National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) is a grassroots organization of volunteers and advocates who turn progressive ideals into action. Inspired by Jewish values, NCJW strives for social justice by improving the quality of life for women, children and families and by safeguarding individual rights and freedoms.  With more than 3,000 members, NCJW/Essex is the largest of nearly 100 regional sections around the country.   Founded in 1912, our Essex section is a collaboration of executive committee members, board members, professional staff, dozens of committee chairs, and hundreds of active volunteers.   We serve Essex County as well as the surrounding region, and all of our programs and services are non-sectarian. <br><br>  



Clear Mountain Zendo looks forward to continued partnership in social engagement with the NCJW/Essex.<br><br>

<p class="SubStyle">CLEAR MOUNTAIN ZEN CENTER, Current Location</p>



<p class="ptxt">On January 15, 2017, after approximately 10 years at a storefront location on Lackawanna Plaza in Montclair, Clear Mountain Zendo moved to its present location, which is at 7 Oak Place in Montclair.  We are located in an office suite on the ground floor of "The Mill at Walnut Street" professional center, a former knitting mill that was converted to office space.  This building is near the NJ Transit Walnut Street train station on the Montclair-Boonton Line (it is on the same side that the restaurant / former train station is located, just a few hundred yards to the north; for long-term Montclarians, "it's near the former State inspection station").  The building has several entrances; our zendo can only be accessed via the 7 Oak Place doorway, which is in the northwest quadrant of the building, facing away from the railroad line and closest to Oak Place.  There will be adequate off-street parking available at the center for our members during non-business hours, i.e. on weekends.  On week days, our members may only park in the lot before 9 am and after 6 pm, which is when most of our weekday activities take place.<br/><br/>



Below you can find a map and two aerial photos to help you find our building and locate our entrance (at the arrow), along with a photo of Head Monk Jeff Kuschner and Mark standing at the doorway, and Sensei Carl Bachmann with some of our members inside our new home.  Although we will greatly miss our former Lackawanna Plaza home, which served us well, our new location is larger and offers more flexibility such as seperate rooms for daisan discussions, a library, and a small coffee pantry.  Our schedule and that of our affiliate space users will remain the same at the new location (with the eventual potential for an expansion of our activities).

<p class="SubStyle">Clear Mountain Zendo Opening Ceremony</p>



<p class="ptxt">The Clear Mountain Zendo sangha held a special Opening Dedication Ceremony on Sunday, June 26, 2017 for its current site at 7 Oak Place, Montclair.  Back in January, we moved out of our former home on Lackawanna Plaza and into our current location.   Since them we have been busy adapting our new space so as to best support the needs of our practice, and we have likewise adapted our practice so as to make the most of our new location.  (Life and Zen are both 2-way streets!)   For example, our current home has several side-rooms which now allow us to have dedicated enclosed spaces for daisan (discussion with the teacher) and for a reading library.  Another room will soon be adapted as a small food and beverage pantry.  Our former space was too small to allow this.<br><br>	

We have finally gotten around to celebrating our new zendo space.  The Dedication service began at 10 am, after a flute solo by Susan Goodman.  Sensei Carl Bachman offered a greeting and some opening remarks to all who gathered to celebrate with us. We then began the ceremony with six sangha members coming forward to place flowers on the altar.  Sensei Carl Bachmann then lit incense and recited a short haiku poem that he wrote:<br><br>

Unseen, the red sun sets behind an old barn<br>

Cold winds blow long gray clouds over black mountains<br>

On a pine branch, a disheveled hawk waits out the rainstorm<br>

Back in town, the storekeeper locks up for the night<br>

Following an evening of scotch, dharma bums sit zazen<br> 

With big headaches<br>

Will we meet again?<br>

Placing a flower on your grave<br>

I wonder where you went<br>

As it is, life appears in many forms<br>

Let us vow not to miss it<br><br>



Sensei next proceeded with a water purification ritual using a bowl from the Buddha altar.  He then invited Roshi Robert Kennedy of Morning Star Zendo in Jersey City, Sensei Ray Cicetti of Empty Bowl Zendo in Morristown, and Michele Daniels of Empty Bowl to offer their own thoughts and reflections.<br><br>  



Roshi Kennedy congratulated Sensei Carl, Head Monk Jeff Kuschner, and the Clear Mountain sangha for its great effort in establishing such a meaningful and conducive space for practice.  He told a story of a businessman friend of his who recently was dispirited after another close business associate had lied to him.  Roshi reflected on how the associate had strayed from the road of trustworthy business dealings, and in doing so had lost something unrecoverable, his reputation amidst other business people whom he would deal with.  Roshi reminded us of how all of us assume roles in life that put us on a road, on a path and mission that may be broad but ultimately requires direction and fealty.  Roshi reminded us that Zen is also a way of life, a wide road, but a road that can be strayed from and lost without support.  He thus concluded by reminding us of the sacred importance of having a zendo, so as to provide the setting for a wise teacher and the companionship of a sangha, as to guide all who wish to walk the road of Zen.  Roshi left us with a short poem from a member of his own sangha:<br><br>



A wind stirs<br>

Ahhh . . . this world . . . this world<br><br>



Sensei Ray Cicietti next spoke of a conversation that he had while weeding outside his house on the day before.  Some friends came by and asked him what he was doing on Sunday, and he told them about the opening ceremony at our Zendo.  The friends told Sensei Ray that to them, Zen seemed like a lonely experience, given all of the quiet sitting time involved.  One asked, “life is so absurd, what’s the point of it?”  Sensei responded that he was going to a zendo just because life is absurd.  Certainly there is a solitary element to Zen practice, but Sensei Ray reminded us that ultimately, we must do Zen together; there is an inherent intimacy and community to true Zen practice, to the “road of Zen” that Roshi spoke of. <br><br> 



Sensei Ray then recalled a sesshin that he attended years ago where a woman who he did not know had sat in absolute silence across from him for seven days.  Once the sesshin concluded and talk resumed, they both expressed to each other a great bond of companionship, a bond that grew wordlessly in the silence of Zen practice.  This provided Sensei Ray with a valuable reminder of the inherent communal and relational nature of the true road to Zen.  Sensei concluded by reminding us of the hopeful nature of Zen, a hopefulness that lights a path through the often-absurd thickets of life.  Zen is a path of hopefulness and possibility, of connection to something greater.  A key part of that connection is our relationship with each other, which a zendo setting helps to make possible. <br><br>



Ms. Daniels spoke of how this ceremony had moved her, how she felt an opening in her heart soon after arriving that morning as Susan was playing the flute.  She reflected on how a zendo creates an opening in the heart, how it provides a sense of “home”, in keeping with the notion that “home is where the heart is”.   It provides a place of companionship and refuge from the absurdity that Sensei Ray spoke of.<br><br>    



Head Monk Jeff Kuschner then led us into a period of quiet zazen sitting for 25 minutes, followed by the chanting of the Heart Sutra and the Great Vows.  Sensei Carl concluded by offering his thanks to our guests and to the Clear Mountain sangha for supporting the move and the upkeep of our physical home.   He reflected on both the contrast and the ultimate unity between "difference" and "sameness" – there are great differences between all of the different people who gather at Clear Mountain, and yet there is an ultimate sameness as we become one body sitting together.  This sameness continues into the other various activities in which the sangha participates, creating a “heart opening” as Ms. Daniels spoke of.  Sensei Carl left us with his gratitude and an expression of love for everyone individually and collectively who is involved in some way in the life of Clear Mountain.<br><br> 



Following the conclusion of the ceremony, the sangha and our guests were invited to share and enjoy some food and refreshments that were kindly arranged and provided by Marina Sandoval with help from Carole Wong Chesek and others.

<p class="SubStyle">Sensei Carl's Note Regarding "The Meaning of Life"</p>



<p class="ptxt">Sensei Carl Bachmann contributed an essay on "The Meaning of Life" to Nicolae Tanase's "Excellence Reporter" web site. Here is <a href="https://excellencereporter.com/…/sensei-carl-genjo-bachman…/" target=_blank>the link</a> to Sensei's thoughts. 



You can also hear Sensei's talk this past Sunday at Clear Mountain regarding life's meaning, and whether the idea of a "meaning to life" is even an important matter, at our web site using <a href="http://www.clearmountainzen.org/audio/Carl_Nov14_16.MP3">this link</a>



The Excellence Reporter is a collection of over 700 short and valuable essays on life from a wide variety of writers, thinkers, teachers, religious leaders, scientists, therapists, etc. The Clear Mountain sangha thanks Mr. Tanase for inviting our teacher to be a part of this wonderful resource to the world.

<p class="SubStyle">For Groups Interested in Short-Term Rental Use of the Clear Mountain Zendo Space</p>



<p class="ptxt">The Clear Mountain Zendo facility is available at certain times throughout the week for short-term use by other small meeting groups with similar spiritual / community-service objectives. We require a fee for each use, but are willing to negotiate the payment amount based upon the group's mission and fiscal means. Our zendo is located in an office suite in "The Mill at Walnut Street" professional building downtown Montclair. Off-street parking is available after 7pm and on Sunday. Our space consists of several smaller rooms with the main meditation hall in the center (this area is carpeted). Bathrooms are available in the office building hallway; refrigeration and food warming are not available. Several electrical outlets are available to power small-sized computer devices, recording devices or  visual presentation devices. Approximately 10 folding chairs and a small folding table can be utilized (although the group can bring its own additional chairs or tables as appropriate for the space available – but storage before or after meetings would not be  available). Sitting cushions are also available for meditation or floor-level group discussions. 



<br>&nbsp; <br>



The space would accommodate groups of up to 25 people. It would be appropriate for meditation sessions or similar small spiritually-oriented meetings or classes, counseling or discussion groups, etc. Any usage would need to be relatively quiet, i.e. no loud music, speech, public address systems, or other high-volume activity, in consideration of our setting amidst other building tenants. We are willing to discuss both one-time and regular usage, based upon time availability. If interested, please e-mail us for more information at contact@clearmountainzen.org.  Please let us know in the e-mail how and when to contact you for further discussion.

<p class="ptxt">InterPlay is an easy to learn embodied form of creative expression that incorporates movement, sound, music, stillness, storytelling, and mindfulness for exploration of our interconnectedness with all beings as well as our connectedness within and in our lives. It helps us to connect to our bodies and authentic voice as well as bring ease and awareness to our experience. It invites people to learn new things about themselves and others. It can include improvisational and experiential movement as well as mindful communication and sharing in any other number of ways and forms.

<br><br>

The event will be held at our Zendo at 7 Oak Place, Montclair NJ, on October 28 and Sept. 9, from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM. All are welcome. If you have any questions or comments, please contact Lissa, our facilitator extraordinaire, who has a lifetime experience of play, a decade of experience in offering and exploring mindful and experiential movement and meditation practices as well as a strong background in mental health care and offering trauma and culturally-sensitive approaches.  Lissa also leads the One Love Sangha, which also meets occasionally at Clear Mountain Zendo.

<br><br>

Suggested Donation: $10. No one will be turned away for lack of funds.

<p class="SubStyle">Formal Installation of Head Monk Jeff Kuschner</p>







<p class="ptxt">On Sunday, April 28, 2013, the Clear Mountain Zendo sangha had a special zazen sitting, to honor our long-time head monk ("shuso") Jeff Kuschner with formal authority transmission from Sensei Carl Bachmann.  Jeff has been involved with Clear Mountain for over 10 years, and has taken on the responsibility of keeping the zendo open (as well as warm and comfortable), keeping the books, paying the bills, guiding the ceremony, providing hospitality for newcomers, and contributing to the on-going mission of teaching and maintaining the Zen way in northern New Jersey.  The sangha would like to formally express its congratulations and its appreciation for Jeff's ongoing service and his many forms of help to we who seek the Zen path.<br/>



<br/>Below, Susho Jeff Kuschner delivers <a href="audio.htm#jeffinst">his talk</a> about Zen, life and service to the sangha, as Doan Carole Wong Chesek and Sensei Carl Bachmann listen.

<p class="SubStyle">Clear Mountain Hosts Local 5th and 6th Graders Studying Medieval Japan</p>

<p class="ptxt">On Monday Nov. 7, 2016, Bill Nathan and Head Monk Jeff Kuschner met with a group of about 20 fifth graders from the Montclair Co-op School to introduce them to the Zen tradition, as part of their study of medieval Japan . We meditated together and chanted the Morning and Evening Gatha, as well as a verse of the Heart Sutra (with Bill keeping time on the makugio). We also did kinhin walking meditation. The trip was arranged by their teacher, who was accompanied by some of the parents. Both Bill and I enjoyed ourselves as did the kids and the accompanying adults.

<br/><br/>

On Tuesday Nov. 8, the sixth graders came in, and both Sensei Carl Bachmann and Head Monk Jeff were there. We had about 18 students along with their teacher, as well as other adults including the Co-op School Principal. We meditated with them and afterward they asked a lot of questions and made some very acute observations about meditation and its benefits. I spoke of my hope that meditation might be used at the beginning or end of the school day and talked with them about developing a home practice. Once again, we had a very good time together. </p><br/> 



<p class="SubStyle">Zendo Has Been Painted!</p>



<p class="ptxt">



The sangha decided late in 2011 that it was time to brighten things up at the zendo, and so a committee was formed to oversee an interior and exterior paint job.  Anne, Carole and Nellie applied their aesthetic sense in selecting wonderful colors, and environmental sense in selecting paint brands with very low volatile hydrocarbon emissions.  George then did an expert job in painting the interior walls and trim, and given the mild weather in late winter, soon finished the exterior.  The sangha expresses its deep gratitude to all involved, and appreciates the new look!

<p class="SubStyle">Zen For Youth</p>



<p class="ptxt">



Jeff Kuschner, <a href="defs.htm#densu" title="Zendo senior administrator">Head Monk (Susho)</a>, has designed and arranged to host an elective seminar regarding Zen and other Eastern forms of spiritual practice for 6th grade youth attending the <a href="http://www.montclaircoop.org/?" target="_blank">Montclair Cooperative School</a>.  The first seminar went from March through June, 2011, and was taught by both Jeff and <a href="defs.htm#sensei" title="Zen teacher">Sensei</a> Carl Bachmann.  Future seminars are anticipated.



<br/><br/>



We hope to expand this outreach to local youth, possibly at other schools in the vicinity if interest develops.

<p class="SubStyle">December 4, 2011 Visit and Talk by Dr. Alan Gettis</p>



<p class="ptxt">



<a href="http://www.drgettis.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Alan Gettis</a>, a clinical psychologist, visited Clear Mountain Zendo during zazen on Sunday, December 4, 2011 to discuss his book <a href="http://itsallpartofthedance.com/" target="_blank">"It's All Part of the Dance: Finding Joy and Meaning in an Upside Down World"</a>.  "It's Part of the Dance" is a collection of parable-like stories, myths, and anecdotes dealing with complex human issues.  It combines Zen wisdom, cognitive behavioral therapy, spirituality, and the new paradigm of positive psychology so as to challenge us to find true happiness.  The Clear Mountain sangha expresses its thanks for an interesting and incisive presentation by Dr. Gettis.

<p class="ptxt">



Carole Wong Chesek, of both the Clear Mountain sangha and Empty Bowl sangha in Morristown, has an exhibit of her ceramic and mixed-media work showing through September 19, 2011 at the <a href="http://www.mocanyc.org/exhibitions/current/unearthing" target="_blank">Museum of Chinese in America</a> in lower Manhattan.
