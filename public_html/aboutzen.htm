<p class="SubStyle">Zen Is . . . What?</p>

<p class="ptxt">

Writers have attempted to define Zen in a myriad of ways.  A quick Internet search for definitional statements regarding Zen turns up the following:

<br/>&nbsp;

<ul>

<li>Zen is a Buddhist school notable for its emphasis on practice and experiential wisdom.</li>



<li>Zen is Zazen. Zen doesn't exist without the personal experience of Zazen, the sitting meditation.</li>





<li>Zen is the realization of the Buddha's enlightenment itself in one's own life and time.</li>



<li>Zen is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese character chan, which is in turn the Chinese translation from the Indian Sanskrit term dhyana, which means meditation.



<li>Zen is a way of liberation.</li>  



<li>Zen is boring.</li>



<li>Zen is all about losing yourself.</li>



<li>Zen is all about finding yourself.</li>



</ul></p><br/>



<p class="ptxt">It would be difficult to judge or reconcile these statements.  As with the ancient story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant" target="_blank">the blind men and the elephant</a>, all of these descriptions hold truth, and yet all fall short of the complete truth.  

Not that profound things cannot be said of Zen.  According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts" target="_blank"><strong>Dr. Alan Watts</strong></a>,"Zen is a method of rediscovering the experience of being alive."  Zen scholar <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20061116a1.html" target="_blank"><strong>Dr. D.T. Suzuki</strong></a> said that “Zen is life”.  Trappist monk <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904007,00.html" target="_blank"><strong>Thomas Merton</strong></a> opined that "Zen is consciousness unstructured by particular form or particular system, a trans-cultural, trans-religious, transformed consciousness".  Other Zen teachers, when faced with the question of defining Zen, say <a href="http://www.dharmazen.com/zen.htm" target="_blank">“Zen is very simple. What are you?”</a>

<p class="SubStyle">Thoughts From Our Sangha</p>

<p class="ptxt">Our sangha members have also had many thoughts about Zen and what it means to them.  Here are some reflections graciously shared by various members:</p><br>

I'm drawn to the silent, ego-less dignity of the Clear Mountain community. Carl's darma talks are inspiring and I carry what is said (as well as what is not said) with me through the week. I have only been able to attend sporadically, but I am always welcomed.

I was originally inspired to start meditation by my dear son Peter. I would see him sitting on his cushions, and it intrigued me. Peter explained a bit about the practice and I started sitting, viewing it as a time that was apart from the rest of my life. I would explain to people that for me, the area where I sat was inside a sacred circle.  I would lay down all my “burdens“ – of worry and concerns – outside of it. I would give myself permission to do this, with no guilt. I felt that I was in a good place.
<br/><br/>
After meditating on and off for about a year, I guess, I was visiting Peter in California and he invited me to join him one morning at the Zen Center of Los Angeles, where he practices. I went to a beginner class and had the opportunity to sit in the Zendo there. It was quite an experience — very special. Peter had told me that it was different sitting with a Sangha. I didn’t really believe him but there was definitely an energy in the Zendo when I was there.
<br/><br/>
After I got home. Peter again encouraged me – this time to find a local Sangha.  I have to admit I was nervous. Going to a Zen Center felt outside my “comfort zone“. I wouldn’t know anyone there.  It wouldn’t be familiar. I wouldn’t be going with my son. Anyway, the day came when Peter was about to make Jukai and accept the Buddhist precepts out in Los Angeles. I suddenly decided that this would be the perfect opportunity for me to “join him“ by finally sitting at a local Zendo (even though I couldn’t be out in Los Angeles witnessing my son’s joyous ceremony). I am so glad that I did!
<br/><br/>
Clear Mountain Zen has been absolutely amazing. The people are so friendly and warm. I never feel uncomfortable even though there are so many things that I don’t know. I’ve also come to believe that I was led to Zen as a way of focusing on living mindfully, in the moment. I talked about this today at Practice Circle. It really resonates with me.  I feel that I have gained so much by starting to learn to “let go“. Zen has become an important part of my life, as has Clear Mountain.  Sensei is a wonderful source of knowledge and support.  I know I have a lot to learn, but that’s fine. I’m perfectly happy to have a Beginners Mind....

<p class="ital sweepleft">Frank Penotti:</p>  
<p class="ptxt"> Zen practice at Clear Mountain has given me the opportunity to tune into my own thoughts and find out for myself on how to sit with them when they come up and sometimes go astray. It is teaching me that it is okay to learn to be calm and centered. It is teaching me patience and how to be in relationship with all people without , hopefully, the judgement and the evaluation. I hope to get to a point where I can show deep appreciation for the lives of other meditators and compassion for their path that led them to Clear Mountain Zen Center. 

<br/><br/>

On another hand, I come from a Christian background and I have a Christian friend who has quietly

told me that empyting one's mind is not a true path to God. It has been suggested that i meditate on the Word of God rather than emptiness. I am split on the suggestion. Jesus proclaimed that "the Kingdom lies within".

He gave an example of prayer,healings and service to be included into God's kingdom. I personally believe that it is about loving oneself properly so that one has the capability of truly loving another person, be it of the other sex or Mother, Father, Sister, Brother, Cousin, or even Boss. Getting past one's guilt and self judgement to a place of creativity and the open expression of gratitude
and  love. And forgiving  those who have caused great harm in one's past, knowingly and or unknowingly. Easier said then done. 

<br/><br/>

So that is why I sit.</p><br>

At the start of the <a href="http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/core9/phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html" target="_blank">Tao Te Ching</a> it is said that the Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.  And so with Zen.  

For me, the best and most honest definition of Zen is  “I don’t know”.  In our technical-scientific culture, ‘not knowing’ is a very bad thing.  But the ancient Zen teachers remind us in a koan, <a href="http://dogobarrygraham.blogspot.com/2011/03/koan-commentary-book-of-serenity-case.html" target="_blank">case 20</a> of the Book of Serenity, that “not knowing” can also be a state of direct encounter and honest wonder.  In a nutshell:

Jizo asked Hogen,  "Where are you going?" Hogen said, "I am on pilgrimage." Jizo said, "What is the purpose of your pilgrimage?" Hogen said, "I don't know." Jizo said, <strong>"Not knowing is most intimate"</strong>.
